 Introduction
 Background
National Basketball Association (NBA) is the best basketball league in the world with millions
of fans worldwide. How players on a team perform is the most important factor that determines
which team wins the championship. Playersâ€™ pay are largely based on their past performances.
However, player performance change from season to season. Each year there are a number of
players who improve dramatically over last year. Those players bring a lot of value, both
competitively and economically, to the teams they belong to. Their importance is widely
recognized by the NBA in that the player who improved the most over last season is awarded
Most Improved Player (MIP) Award. Therefore, it is advantageous for teams to accurately
predict whether and how much a player will improve in the next season. For example, this
information can be used to target players to acquire in trades or signings.
 Problem
Data that might contribute to determining player improvement might include his performance
last season, his age, his draft status, his position, and metrics that describe what kind of player he
is. This project aims to predict whether and how much a player will improve the next season
based on these data.
